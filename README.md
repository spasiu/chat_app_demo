# Chat app demo

This project is a simple Node.js application using Express to serve a static site and handle chat completion requests via the OpenAI API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Additionally, you need an API token from OpenAI. If you don't have one, you can get it from the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

## Get started

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-chat-completion-api.git cd node-chat-completion-api`
2. **Install the dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Set your OpenAI API token:** Open the `index.js` file and replace `'YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_TOKEN'` with your actual OpenAI API token. `const OPEN_AI_TOKEN = 'YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_TOKEN';`
4. To start the server, run: `node index` inside te project folder.

Your application will be running on [http://localhost:3434](http://localhost:3434).
